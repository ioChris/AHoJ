# Apo-Holo Juxtaposition

Python tool for search and alignment of apo structures for given holo structure.

Tool for creating apo-holo datasets.


##  Objective
**Given the holo form of a protein** (the complex of a protein structure **and its user specified ligand(s)**): 
1. **find** all unbound forms of that protein (**apo-proteins**) that are lacking the specified ligand(s).
2. **align apo-proteins** to the query holo protein   

Note: ligands are confined to chemical components that are not part of the protein according to the PDB 
(phosphorylated amino acids can also be considered and specified as ligands). 
Ligands are named and defined according to their (up to) 3-character code from PDB (i.e. ATP, HEM, ZN).

##  Methodology
The application is conducting a search within the experimentally determined protein structures in the Protein Data Bank. 
It retrieves identical proteins with known structures, and then looks whether the specified ligand(s) are present or absent. 
Depending on the user’s preferences, the application can look for the specified ligand(s) in a single specified chain, or the whole protein (all chains). 
It can find apo-proteins that i) simply lack the specified ligand in a given binding site (but may bind a different ligand at the same site), or ii) 
lack any known ligand in a given binding site and thus constitute universal apo- sites.

##  Requirements
The application was built and initially ran in a Windows 10 computer. The python packages were all installed through the Anaconda package manager.
The python version and packages used to run the application appear below:

* Python  3.8.11
* PyMOL		 2.4.1
* pywget		0.31
* wget		  3.2
* tmalign 20170708   (? TODO: check if it is part of psico)   
* pymol-psico 3.4.19


Note: Newer versions of these packages should be functional as long as they are inter-compatible, including the open-source version of PyMOL.

Aside of the package dependencies, the application is using two precompiled files that are based on the SIFTS UniProt – PDB chain mapping.

* `pdb_chain_uniprot_REVERSE_SPnum.txt`
* `pdb_chain_uniprot_dict.txt`
                                 
These files need to be generated by `download_n_modify_SIFTS.py` before running the main script `apoholoR_web.py`.


## Installation instructions

### Windows

for Windows 10 64bit OS
Modified guide from https://omicx.cc/posts/2021-04-20-install-pymol-windows/

##### 1.  Install Anaconda or Miniconda (Anaconda comes with several packages preinstalled).
For Windows 10 64-bit version, miniconda3-py3.9.7 (here, Conda 4.11.0 Python 3.9.7) was installed.
https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Windows-x86_64.exe


##### 2.  Create PyMOL environment
Click the Start menu and run “Anaconda Prompt (miniconda3)” “as administrator”.
~~~sh
conda create -n pymol      # Create a virtual environment named pymol
conda activate pymol       # Activate the new environment
~~~

##### 3.  Install supporting packages
~~~sh
conda install -c conda-forge pip numpy pmw
conda install -c anaconda pywget
conda install -c speleo3 tmalign
conda install -c speleo3 pymol-psico
~~~     

##### 4.  Download PyMOL whl files
There are several pre-compiled Open-Source PyMOL distributions from "Christoph Gohlke of the Laboratory for Fluorescence Dynamics, University of California, Irvine":
https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pymol-open-source
Here, we download the following files (both “pymol.whl” and “pymol_launcher.whl”):
~~~
pymol-2.6.0a0-cp39-cp39-win_amd64.whl
pymol_launcher-2.1-cp39-cp39-win_amd64.whl
~~~

##### 5.  Install whl files
In the conda pymol environment, switch to download directory (e.g., D:\Downloads)
* Switch to Drive D:
* Enter the downloads directory (`cd Downloads`)
* Install pymol_launcher first
~~~sh
pip install --no-index --find-links="%CD%" pymol_launcher-2.1-cp39-cp39-win_amd64.whl
~~~

PyMOL is installed automatically.
To update PyMOL later, run
~~~sh
pip install --upgrade --no-deps pymol-2.6.0a0-cp39-cp39-win_amd64.whl
~~~

##### 6.  Launch PyMOL
In an activated pymol environment, run 
~~~sh
pymol
~~~

### Linux
   
#### Using conda

*TODO*

#### Without conda

*TODO*

## Setup and usage instructions

The application consists of the main script
~~~
apoholo_J.py
~~~

and a helper script that downloads a UniProt-PDB chain mapping file and compiles 2 helper files
~~~
download_n_modify_SIFTS.py
~~~

Before the main script is run, the helper script must be run so that the UniProt file is downloaded, 
and the helper files are compiled and saved to the designated folder of the server. 
After the first run, the helper script should be run once a week to update the existing UniProt files. 
The script replaces the old files automatically.

The helper script needs no arguments to run, other than setting the root folder for the server, 
according to which it will create a subdirectory with the helper files (e.g. root/SIFTS).
As soon as it finishes running, the main script can be run.
The main script has a number of user parameters that have preset defaults within the script, 
and currently needs a single line input from the user to run. 
This single line input can carry anywhere from 1 to 3 arguments (right now), 
which are separated by whitespace characters. 

The maximum arguments within the single line input are of this form:
~~~
<pdb_id> <chains> <ligands>
~~~  

* `pdb_id`: this is the 4-character code of a PDB protein structure. This argument is obligatory and only 1 PDB ID can be input per line. (i.e. “1a73” or “3fav” or “3FAV”)
* `chains`: A single chain or multiple chains separated by commas or “ALL” in the case of all chains (i.e. “A” or “A,C,D” or “ALL”). This argument is non-obligatory, if omitted, all chains will be considered.
* `ligands`: A single ligand, multiple ligands separated by commas but without whitespace, or no ligands can be input per line (i.e. “HEM” or “hem” or “ATP” or “ZN” or “HEM,ATP,ZN”). This argument is non-obligatory, if omitted, the user should activate the automatic detection of the ligands in the structure from the available option, unless the user is starting with an apo structure, in which case they will need to activate the reverse mode (search for holo from apo).

Example of an input argument (query):
~~~
python apoholo_J.py --single_line_input '1a73 A ZN'
~~~

The application will fetch the structure 1a73, get chain A, and look for zinc+2 (ZN) ligands to verify the input argument. 
If ZN is found in chain A of 1a73 (1a73A), it will retrieve all other known chains that belong to the same protein with 1a73A, 
it will align them with 1a73A and look for ZN ligands at the superimposed binding site of ZN in 1a73A. If it finds protein chains with ZN, 
it will list them as HOLO, if the superimposed site is empty of ligands, the chain will be listed as APO. If another ligand is detected on that site instead of ZN, 
the chain will be listed as APO or HOLO, depending on the user’s preferences (if the user wants APO with no other ligands there, 
it will be listed as HOLO, and if the user does not mind other ligands in this binding site, it will be listed as APO).
